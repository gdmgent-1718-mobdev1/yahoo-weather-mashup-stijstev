<h1>Weather App</h1>
<p>Using the Yahoo Weather API<p>
<strong>Realized by Stijn Stevens for Mobile Development I.</strong>
<h2>Brief Summary</h2>
<p>This app displays the weather for 8 predefined cities in the world. Adding more only requires the city name and the WOEID.
It displays metrics such as temperature, condition, wind speed and direction and humidity. A five-day forecast is also provided at the bottom of the card.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Displays weather metrics per city</li>
  <li>Changes icons and images according to the weather condition</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known bugs and goofs</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Goof: The fallback icon for forecast and condition is the cloud, which isn't always true</li>
  <li>Goof: The wind direction isn't very accurate. It shows either N, E, S and W. No intermediary values</li>
</ul>
